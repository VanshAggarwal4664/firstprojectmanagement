## Significance of Milestone 
This milestone marks a significant checkpoint in the project, as it will provide a clear understanding of the product's direction and offer an opportunity for initial feedback. It ensures the project stays on track for meeting its long-term objectives.


## Tracking Progress
The project board will help organize and track the current state of all issues. Team members can move tasks from "To Do" to "In Progress" as they begin work, and finally to "Done" upon completion. This provides transparency to the entire team, ensuring accountability and visibility of progress.

## Contribution to Milestone
Both issues are necessary to ensure the prototypeâ€™s usability and completeness, which is vital for a successful first delivery.

## Reflection on Project Management Tools
Using project management features like milestones, issues, and project boards in GitHub makes all the difference for efficient team collaboration and structuring of any project. Milestones give a defined scope set with the dates of delivering specific aspects. Issues help to break the tasks into workable pieces and each one knows what and how to do it. The project board gives it a visual overview that keeps the team organized and driven.

One of the issues we might encounter is regular communication and updating of the board. If the members forget to move tasks from one column to another or update their progress regarding the issues, it might lead to confusion and poor management. Overcoming this challenge will depend on check-ins and clear expectations about these tools.
