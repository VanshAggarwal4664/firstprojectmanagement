## Significance of Milestone 
This milestone marks a significant checkpoint in the project, as it will provide a clear understanding of the product's direction and offer an opportunity for initial feedback. It ensures the project stays on track for meeting its long-term objectives.


## Tracking Progress
The project board will help organize and track the current state of all issues. Team members can move tasks from "To Do" to "In Progress" as they begin work, and finally to "Done" upon completion. This provides transparency to the entire team, ensuring accountability and visibility of progress.

## Contribution to Milestone
Both issues are necessary to ensure the prototypeâ€™s usability and completeness, which is vital for a successful first delivery.
